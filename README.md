## 🧠 About PulseAI_Heartbeat

**PulseAI_Heartbeat** was developed as a companion and sub-version of my larger project, [**Psychological App**](https://github.com/Thesleepybminh/Psychological_App).

While *Psychological App* serves as a full-scale React Native mobile platform for mental-health and wellness support through AI-driven interaction, *PulseAI_Heartbeat* focuses on testing and optimizing its data-analysis and backend logic modules.

During the initial development period, several code bugs in *Psychological App* prevented me from including it in my résumé submission.  
All issues were subsequently fixed, and the project was **fully reuploaded on November 2nd** with stable performance and updated documentation.

Together, both projects reflect my ongoing effort to combine **psychology and computing** to create accessible tools for emotional well-being.
